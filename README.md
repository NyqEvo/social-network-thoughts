# Social Network "THOUGHTS"

## Description

This project is the back end for a simple social media platform. It used mongoDB and express to make it functional in insomnia. Schemas were made for Users, Thoughts, and Reactions to a User's Thoughts. The requests were built in the controllers files and exported to the appropriate routes folder, where they are used on the necessary routes for each request. This project was made to solidify and demonstrate my ability to create models with functional relationships to each other and route correctly to add, display, or manipulate the data in the database.

## Table of Contents
